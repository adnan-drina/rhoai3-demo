# Usage:
#   1. Create HF token: oc create secret generic hf-token -n minio-storage --from-literal=token=hf_xxx
#   2. Apply individual jobs:
#      oc apply -f upload-mistral-bf16.yaml  # 4-GPU model (~50GB)
#      oc apply -f upload-mistral-fp8.yaml   # 1-GPU model (~25GB)
#
# NOTE: These are NOT auto-applied by ArgoCD (hook: Skip)
# Apply manually when needed

  - upload-mistral-bf16.yaml   # Mistral Small 24B BF16 (100Gi PVC) - 4-GPU
  - upload-mistral-awq.yaml    # Mistral Small 24B AWQ (40Gi PVC) - 1-GPU (RECOMMENDED)
