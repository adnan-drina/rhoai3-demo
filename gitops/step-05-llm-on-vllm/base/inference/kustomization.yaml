# InferenceServices using RHOAI 3.0 Official S3 Storage Approach
# Model weights are stored in MinIO and downloaded by KServe storage-initializer
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. MinIO deployed (Step-03)
#   2. Model weights uploaded to rhoai-artifacts bucket
#   3. storage-config secret in private-ai namespace
#
# Node Placement Strategy:
#   - 1-GPU models → g6.4xlarge (via nodeSelector)
#   - 4-GPU models → g6.12xlarge (via nodeSelector)

resources:
  # Mistral Small 24B - 1 GPU deployment with FP8 quantization
  - mistral-small-24b.yaml
  # Mistral Small 24B - 4 GPU tensor parallel with BF16
  - mistral-small-24b-tp4.yaml
