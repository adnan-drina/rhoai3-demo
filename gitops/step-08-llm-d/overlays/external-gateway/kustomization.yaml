# Optional overlay: expose llm-d via a dedicated Gateway.
#
# Why this is an overlay (not base):
# - Creating additional `Gateway` objects in `openshift-ingress` can provision
#   extra cloud load balancers and managed DNS records.
# - Misconfiguration (e.g., wildcard hostnames) can impact the cluster `*.apps`
#   domain and break the OpenShift console.
#
# Apply only when you need north-south access to the llm-d HTTPRoute.
