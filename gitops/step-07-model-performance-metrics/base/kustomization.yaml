# Step 07: Model Performance Metrics - "The ROI of Quantization"
# ============================================================================
# Demonstrates why Inference Efficiency is the most important metric for
# enterprise AI deployments.
#
# The Narrative:
#   - Baseline: Mistral-3-BF16 sharded across 4 GPUs ($$$$)
#   - Competitor: Mistral-3-INT4 running on 1 GPU ($)
#   - Goal: Find the "Efficiency Delta" - where does each model saturate?
#
# Components:
#   1. Grafana Dashboard (grafana/)
#      - Connected to OpenShift User Workload Monitoring
#      - Pre-configured vLLM performance dashboards
#      - Model comparison with KV Cache and TTFT metrics
#
#   2. Dashboards (dashboards/)
#      - vLLM Overview: Queue status, KV cache, throughput
#      - Model Comparison: Side-by-side performance table
#
#   3. GuideLLM Benchmarking (guidellm/)
#      - Poisson distribution for realistic human traffic simulation
#      - Rate sweep from 0.1 to 5.0 req/s
#      - ROI comparison scripts (INT4 vs BF16)
#
# SLA Targets:
#   - TTFT: < 500ms (excellent), < 1.0s (acceptable)
#   - TPOT: > 20 tokens/sec
#   - KV Cache: < 85% (warning at 95%)
#
