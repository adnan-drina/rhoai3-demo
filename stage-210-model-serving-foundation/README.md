# Stage 210: Model Serving Baseline with vLLM

**Theme:** Production GenAI and Private Data
**Concept:** Prove that a real LLM can be served on governed GPU capacity before
evaluating or exposing it as a shared enterprise service.

---

## Why This Matters

GPU capacity is useful only after the platform can turn it into a working model
endpoint. For a regulated European enterprise, this is the point where raw
accelerator infrastructure becomes a controlled GenAI capability: model
artifacts, runtime selection, endpoint exposure, authentication, and resource
strategy all need to be explicit before teams can trust the service.

Red Hat positions production inference as a core Red Hat AI 3 capability:
efficient serving with vLLM, distributed inference with llm-d when scale
requires it, governed MaaS access, and accelerator-aware operations. This stage
uses the smallest useful slice of that story. It enables the standard
KServe-based model serving platform, ensures Nemotron can be served with vLLM
on the GPU profiles created in Stage 120, and adds lightweight GuideLLM and
Grafana evidence before MaaS governance is introduced.

The stage does not yet turn the model into a governed shared service. That is
deliberate. First we prove the platform can host a GPU-backed LLM endpoint;
then this stage captures a simple GuideLLM/Grafana serving baseline, and Stage
220 publishes validated access through Models-as-a-Service.

| Grafana Operator | Provides demo dashboards for vLLM latency, queue, throughput, KV cache, and GPU signals. This is a community-operator demo exception, not a Red Hat product dependency. | [Grafana Operator API reference](https://grafana.github.io/grafana-operator/docs/api/) |

| llm-d showroom Module 2 | Provides the benchmark pattern this stage partially replicates: `benchmark-data` PVC, `prompts.csv`, GuideLLM concurrent `32,64` profile, and `llm-performance` Grafana dashboard. | [llm-d showroom - Observe Single-GPU Behaviour](https://rhpds.github.io/llm-d-showroom/modules/workshop/llm-d/04-module-02.html) |
| Red Hat AI services llm-d reference | Provides the concrete shared-prefix prompt data and Grafana dashboard JSON adapted into this stage. | [rh-aiservices-bu/rhaoi3-llm-d](https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/rhaoi3-llm-d) |
| Red Hat AI MaaS code assistant quickstart | Provides a Red Hat-maintained implementation reference for Nemotron 3 Nano on AWS `g6e.2xlarge`/L40S infrastructure, including vLLM arguments, resource sizing, MaaS `LLMInferenceService`, tiered access, and Grafana usage patterns. | [rh-ai-quickstart/maas-code-assistant](https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart/maas-code-assistant) |

This stage uses direct model serving, not Models-as-a-Service and not llm-d.
MaaS governance and external OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` registration belong to
Stage 220. Distributed inference with llm-d remains a later scale-out option.
EvalHub, MLflow, LMEval, judge-based evaluation, and risk assessment remain
deferred to later MLOps/evaluation stages.

The RH Brain search found Red Hat source material for Nemotron 3 Nano as a
validated model and strong GuideLLM/vLLM/llm-d baseline guidance. The
Red Hat-maintained MaaS code assistant quickstart adds a concrete
implementation reference that was tested with L40S GPUs on AWS `g6e.2xlarge`
instances. Stage 210 adapts the direct serving subset of that configuration:
one Nemotron endpoint, one GPU, `2` CPU and `16Gi` memory requested, `4` CPU and
`24Gi` memory limited, and the Nemotron-specific vLLM flags for usage
reporting, access-log reduction, prefix caching, context length, batched-token
scheduling, tool calling, trusted remote code, and reasoning parser support.
After the first saturation run, Stage 210 uses an `8192` token serving context
as the default chat/RAG operating envelope for one GPU. Larger context windows
must be justified by RAG-specific benchmark evidence before being exposed
through MaaS.
The quickstart's MaaS `LLMInferenceService`, gateway, tier, and RBAC patterns
remain Stage 220 input.

The quickstart deploys a sample modelcar URI for its scenario. This demo keeps
the Red Hat registry artifact
`oci://registry.redhat.io/rhai/modelcar-nvidia-nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b-fp8:3.0`
as the preferred model source and uses live vLLM metrics plus GuideLLM results
to tune from evidence.

For GuideLLM token accounting, the benchmark script uses the public Hugging
Face processor ID `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8`, while the served
model ID remains the RHOAI deployment name
`nvidia-nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b`. The benchmark data is a GitOps-managed
`benchmark-data` PVC populated with a `prompts.csv` file adapted from the Red
Hat AI services llm-d reference implementation.

- New in this stage: KServe model serving platform enablement and the
  dashboard-ready or script-created vLLM deployment path.
- Already available: OpenShift GitOps, ODF MCG object storage, RHOAI Dashboard,
  Model Registry, `demo-sandbox`, NFD, NVIDIA GPU Operator, Kueue queues, and
  GPU hardware profiles.
- Argo CD visibility: open `stage-110-rhoai-base-platform` to confirm the
  KServe `DataScienceCluster` patch, and open
  `stage-210-model-serving-foundation` to confirm user workload monitoring and
  Grafana resources. Stage 210 still does not own a second
  `DataScienceCluster`.
- Value of the integration: GPU capacity becomes usable by a model endpoint,
  while MaaS exposure stays separated into the next stage.

For repeatable redeployments, the deploy script uses an idempotent
discover-or-create flow:

1. Use `demo-registry` when it already exists; otherwise rely on the Stage 110
   GitOps desired state to create it.
2. Use the existing Nemotron model/version/artifact metadata when present;
   otherwise create metadata through the Model Registry REST API.
3. Use the existing Nemotron `InferenceService` when present; otherwise create
   the vLLM runtime and endpoint from the active RHOAI template and OCI
   modelcar source.
4. Reconcile the existing or newly created endpoint to the curated Nemotron
   vLLM argument and resource profile.

## Validation Evidence

Validated on `cluster-klvxt` on 2026-06-12:

- `stage-210-model-serving-foundation/deploy.sh` converged Stage 110 and Stage
  210 Argo CD Applications to `Synced/Healthy`.
- `stage-210-model-serving-foundation/validate.sh` passed 49 checks after
  reconciling the curated Nemotron vLLM args, resource sizing, structured
  tool-call validation, Grafana datasource access, and dashboard metric
  alignment.
- A direct `/v1/chat/completions` smoke test returned assistant content,
  reasoning metadata, and usage tokens through the vLLM endpoint after the
  curated configuration was applied.
- A forced tool-call smoke test returned a structured `get_weather` tool call
  with `city: Amsterdam`, confirming the Nemotron tool-calling parser path.
- A short GuideLLM smoke run with one concurrent request and a 10-second window
  completed with 11 successful requests and zero errors. The observed p95 TTFT
  was about 71 ms, p95 ITL about 7.1 ms, p95 end-to-end request latency about
  0.98 seconds, and mean output throughput about 132 output tokens/second.
- After reducing the default serving context to `8192` tokens, a policy
  benchmark tested short chat and 4k-context RAG profiles. Short chat remains a
  good fit for an initial `8` concurrent-user service lane on one GPU. RAG-style
  requests should start with a stricter `2` concurrent-user lane because the
  `4` concurrent run showed a p95 latency spike.

These numbers are smoke-test evidence for the harness and endpoint, not a
production capacity claim. Use the recorded chat/RAG policy profiles in
`docs/OPERATIONS.md` as the first input for Stage 220 MaaS quotas and rerun
them whenever the model, runtime, GPU shape, or prompt profile changes.
