# How to propose changes in this repo

When responding with changes, always include:
1) **Files to change** (exact paths)
2) **What to add/modify** (small diffs or full file content if short)
3) **How to apply** (from GitOps folder, or `deploy.sh`, or exact commands)
4) **How to validate** (deterministic `oc` checks)

Avoid:
- "Just click around in the UI"
- "It should work"
- Unverifiable claims

If there is ambiguity in docs or versions:
- State the assumption explicitly
- Provide a verification command to confirm the assumption on the target cluster
