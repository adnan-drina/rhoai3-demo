# OpenShift + RHOAI Manifest Rules

## Doc-validated schemas only
- If editing/creating CRs (Operators, CRDs, custom resources), verify the schema first:
  - `oc explain <kind>`
  - `oc get crd <name> -o yaml` (to confirm versions/fields)
- Do not "guess" fields based on other versions or upstream projects.

## Version alignment
- Ensure all manifests align with:
  - RHOCP 4.20 behaviors/APIs
  - RHOAI 3.0 operator/CR APIs
- If the cluster exposes different API versions than expected, call it out and adapt the manifest accordingly.

## Every step must include validation
When adding a manifest, also provide:
- How to confirm the operator reconciled it (events/status conditions)
- The minimal `oc` commands to verify it works
