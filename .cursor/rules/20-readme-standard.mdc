# README Requirements for Demo Steps

Each demo step README must include:

## 1) Goal
- What the step demonstrates and why it matters to RHOAI on OpenShift.

## 2) Prerequisites
- Cluster assumptions (RHOCP 4.20, RHOAI 3.0)
- Required CLIs / access
- Namespaces, operators, or dependencies

## 3) Architecture / What gets deployed
- Bullet list of resources/components created in this step.
- Where manifests live under `gitops/`.

## 4) Reproduce (two paths)
### A) One-shot
- `./deploy.sh <step>` (or equivalent)
- Expected output / what to watch for

### B) Step-by-step (exact commands)
- Explicit `oc` commands in order
- Include `--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true` where needed for self-signed clusters

## 5) Validate
- Clear checks that confirm success:
  - `oc get ...`
  - `oc describe ...`
  - logs, routes, health endpoints, etc.
- Prefer deterministic checks; avoid "it should look fine".

## 6) Rollback / Cleanup (if safe)
- How to delete resources (GitOps revert, `oc delete -k`, etc.)

## 7) References (required)
- Link to the *official* RHOAI 3.0 and/or RHOCP 4.20 documentation sections used.
- If a manifest field/value is derived from docs, reference it here.

## Style rules
- Use copy-pastable commands.
- Mention any expected delays and what to wait for (pods ready, CR reconciled, etc.).
