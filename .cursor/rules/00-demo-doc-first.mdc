# Project Purpose (always in effect)
This repository is a demo of adopting open-source LLMs on private infrastructure using **Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) 3.0** on **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) 4.20**.

## Absolute priority: official documentation alignment
- Treat official **RHOAI 3.0** and **RHOCP 4.20** documentation as the source of truth.
- The repo has official docs indexed in Cursor (via @docs). When implementing or validating anything, consult those indexed docs.
- Do **not** invent CR fields, API versions, annotations, or operator configurations. If unsure, say what you need to verify and propose the verification command.

## YAML correctness requirement
Whenever generating or modifying Kubernetes/OpenShift YAML:
- Use the **exact** `apiVersion`, `kind`, and schema supported by the installed operators/cluster version.
- Validate with at least one of:
  - `oc explain <resource>[.<field>]`
  - `oc api-resources | grep -i <kind>`
  - `oc get crd | grep -i <name>`
  - `oc apply --dry-run=server -f ...`
- Prefer small, composable manifests; avoid overly clever templating.

## Demo reliability > novelty
- Prefer stable, boring solutions that consistently work.
- Every change must be reproducible from GitOps (`gitops/`) and must include clear verification steps.

## Self-signed certs are acceptable to bypass
- It is acceptable to use `--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true` (oc) and `-k/--insecure` (curl) where it improves demo flow.
- Do not spend time implementing production-grade PKI for this demo unless explicitly requested.
