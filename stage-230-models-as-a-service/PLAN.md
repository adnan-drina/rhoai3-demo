# Stage 230: Models-as-a-Service Plan

## Intent

- Stage identifier: `230`
- Stage family: `2xx Production GenAI and Private Data`
- Stage slug: `stage-230-models-as-a-service`
- Concept introduced: Governed model access through Red Hat OpenShift AI
  Models-as-a-Service.
- Target audience: Platform engineer, solution architect, AI governance owner,
  and application developer.
- Enterprise value: Turns validated model endpoints into governed shared
  services with subscriptions, authorization policies, API keys, quotas, usage
  tracking, and clear separation between internal GPU-backed models and
  external provider models.
- Depends on: `stage-110-rhoai-base-platform`,
  `stage-120-gpu-as-a-service`, and `stage-210-model-serving-foundation`.
- New components planned: MaaS enablement on the shared
  `DataScienceCluster`, Red Hat Connectivity Link and Kuadrant prerequisites,
  MaaS Gateway API resources, Authorino TLS setup, PostgreSQL-backed API-key
  storage, `Tenant`, `MaaSModelRef`, `MaaSSubscription`,
  `MaaSAuthPolicy`, `ExternalModel`, and a MaaS-published Nemotron endpoint.
- Phase-one implementation: cert-manager preflight validation, GitOps-managed
  RHCL, Kuadrant, Authorino TLS, `maas-default-gateway`, in-cluster PostgreSQL
  16 demo database, `maas-db-config`, dashboard flags, DSC MaaS/Llama Stack
  enablement, and `Tenant`.
- Phase-two implementation: schema-validated external OpenAI `gpt-5.4-nano`
  `ExternalModel`, `MaaSModelRef`, `MaaSSubscription`, `MaaSAuthPolicy`, and
  MaaS namespace admin RoleBinding for `rhods-admins`. Live rollout requires a
  local provider key Secret; do not use placeholders.
- Local model implementation: schema-validated Nemotron
  `LLMInferenceService` and `MaaSModelRef` in `models-as-a-service`, with a
  MaaS namespace `LocalQueue` and a deploy-time cleanup guard that removes any
  stale direct Nemotron deployment from `demo-sandbox`.
- Namespace decision: MaaS model references must point at the namespace that
  contains the underlying backend. For the governed private model path, this
  project intentionally makes `models-as-a-service` the backend namespace for
  Nemotron rather than keeping the shared backend in the user-facing
  `demo-sandbox` project.
- Gateway TLS pattern: create stable `maas-gateway-tls` in `openshift-ingress`
  from the active OpenShift ingress certificate before applying
  `maas-default-gateway`; then patch listener hostnames to
  `maas.<apps-domain>`.
- External model planned: OpenAI `gpt-5.4-nano` registered through the MaaS
  `ExternalModel` path.
- Validation priority: deterministic API and CLI validation first, with the
  dashboard and Gen AI studio experience used as the audience-facing proof.
- User-facing experience: `ai-admin` administers MaaS; `ai-developer` does not
  get direct access to the `models-as-a-service` project and consumes models
  through Gen AI studio AI asset endpoints and MaaS API keys.
- Full experience scope: include MaaS subscriptions, authorization policies,
  API keys, governed local Nemotron, governed external OpenAI, Gen AI
  Playground consumption, MaaS observability, and clear Technology Preview
  labeling for preview features.
- Existing components reused: Stage 210 Nemotron vLLM configuration,
  Grafana/User Workload Monitoring, `demo-sandbox` as the consumer project,
  and Stage 120 GPU hardware profiles.

## Non-Goals

- Do not run a second GPU-heavy Nemotron backend alongside the direct Stage
  210 endpoint on the single default GPU node. Stage 230 must remove stale
  direct dashboard-created Nemotron serving resources from `demo-sandbox`
  before reconciling the MaaS-owned `LLMInferenceService`.
- Do not commit OpenAI provider API keys, MaaS API keys, database passwords, or
  generated tokens.
- Do not claim billing-grade metering. MaaS usage data is for demo showback and
  capacity planning.
- Do not claim llm-d monitoring or MaaS observability as GA. Label Technology
  Preview and Developer Preview surfaces explicitly.
- Do not use external OpenAI models for workloads where provider-side
  processing is not allowed by the demo scenario.
- Do not hide the external-provider boundary. Prompts, context, and generated
  content for `gpt-5.4-nano` leave the cluster and must be limited to approved
  demo workloads.
- Do not give `ai-developer` administrative access to the MaaS project. The
  user-facing path is through OpenShift AI dashboard assets and MaaS-governed
  API consumption, not namespace administration.
- Do not expose the full Nemotron `131072` context window through the first
  MaaS policy. Keep large-context RAG as an explicit tuning decision after
  Stage 210/230 measurements prove the operating envelope.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] README explains MaaS value, subscriptions, quotas, API keys, and
  internal/external model governance without runbook detail.
- [ ] Official RHOAI 3.4 MaaS, llm-d, Gateway/API, and dashboard feature-flag
  sources are captured.
- [ ] Red Hat quickstart and sibling-demo references are bounded as
  implementation examples, not product API authority.
- [ ] Live CRD/schema checks are completed after MaaS prerequisites are
  installed.
- [ ] MaaS prerequisites are installed and healthy through GitOps.
- [ ] The shared Stage 110 `DataScienceCluster` owner remains the only DSC
  owner; Stage 230 adds a focused MaaS patch through that owner.
- [ ] Local Nemotron is published through a schema-verified MaaS model
  reference.
- [ ] External OpenAI `gpt-5.4-nano` GitOps resources are published through an
  `ExternalModel` backed by a real Kubernetes Secret or approved secret store.
- [ ] Demo users have both `MaaSSubscription` quota and `MaaSAuthPolicy`
  gateway authorization before access is claimed.
- [ ] Validation proves model listing, API-key creation, local Nemotron
  inference, external OpenAI inference, quota/rate-limit behavior, and
  forbidden access for an unauthorized subject.
- [ ] `ai-admin` can administer MaaS resources and policies; `ai-developer`
  can discover and consume allowed MaaS models without direct access to the
  MaaS administration namespace.
- [ ] Gen AI Playground can use the MaaS-published local and external models
  through AI asset endpoints.
- [ ] MaaS observability is enabled and validates subscription/request/token
  signals where the installed Technology Preview components expose them.

## Current Schema Findings

Read-only schema discovery on `cluster-klvxt` on 2026-06-12:

| Resource | Current state | Planning impact |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| `llminferenceservices.serving.kserve.io` | Present; `v1alpha1` and `v1alpha2` served, `v1alpha2` storage. | Stage 230 targets the live storage version after official-doc and schema review. Do not copy older `v1alpha1` examples blindly. |
| `leaderworkersets.leaderworkerset.x-k8s.io` | Required by the RHOAI llm-d/`LLMInferenceService` prerequisite path. | Stage 230 installs the LeaderWorkerSet Operator through GitOps before creating the Nemotron `LLMInferenceService`. |
| `llminferenceserviceconfigs.serving.kserve.io` | Present as `serving.kserve.io/v1alpha2`. | Review only if Stage 230 needs custom config resources. |
| Gateway API `GatewayClass`, `Gateway`, `HTTPRoute` | Present as `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1`; `maas-default-gateway` is live with `maas-gateway-tls` and `maas.apps.cluster-klvxt.klvxt.sandbox279.opentlc.com`. | Use the deploy wrapper to inject the environment hostname into the Argo CD Application before sync. Do not hide Gateway listener fields with `RespectIgnoreDifferences` when they must be repaired through GitOps. |
| `kuadrants.kuadrant.io` and `authorinos.operator.authorino.kuadrant.io` | Present; `Kuadrant` and `Authorino` are Ready. | Gateway policy prerequisites are healthy for model publication and subscription work. |
| RHCL `Subscription` | Stage 230 pins `rhcl-operator.v1.3.3` with `installPlanApproval: Manual` and a GitOps approval job for only that CSV. | Do not use automatic RHCL upgrades for MaaS until the RHOAI/RHCL/Gateway path validates end to end on the newer CSV. |
| MaaS CRDs | `Tenant`, `MaaSModelRef`, `MaaSSubscription`, `MaaSAuthPolicy`, and `ExternalModel` are present as `maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1` with `v1alpha1` as storage. | Use `maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1`; do not use `models.opendatahub.io` examples from documentation or quickstarts without conversion. |
| `MaaSModelRef.spec.modelRef` | Requires `kind` enum `LLMInferenceService` or `ExternalModel`, and `name`. | Create one model ref for the local Nemotron `LLMInferenceService` and one for the external OpenAI `ExternalModel` after backend resources are ready. |
| `ExternalModel.spec` | Requires `provider`, `endpoint`, `targetModel`, and `credentialRef.name`; the referenced Secret must contain data key `api-key`. | OpenAI provider credentials remain local Secret material; GitOps may reference the Secret name but must not commit the key. |
| `MaaSSubscription.spec` | Requires `owner`, `modelRefs[]`, and per-model `tokenRateLimits[]`; groups are objects with `name`; windows support `s`, `m`, and `h`; `priority` and `tokenMetadata` are available. | Initial policies should encode Stage 210 chat/RAG limits and showback metadata with `organizationId`, `costCenter`, and labels. |
| `MaaSAuthPolicy.spec` | Requires `subjects` and `modelRefs[]`; `meteringMetadata` supports `organizationId`, `costCenter`, and labels. | Access claims require both subscription quota and auth-policy authorization. |
| `Tenant.spec` | Supports `apiKeys.maxExpirationDays`, `gatewayRef`, `externalOIDC`, and telemetry with `captureModelUsage`, `captureOrganization`, `captureGroup`, and `captureUser`. | Keep `captureUser` a deliberate privacy decision; enable model-usage telemetry for demo showback, not billing-grade invoicing. |
| `llamastackdistributions.llamastack.io` | Present after MaaS/Llama Stack Operator enablement. | Gen AI Studio and Playground flows can be validated in the next phase. |
| `OdhDashboardConfig.spec.dashboardConfig.vLLMDeploymentOnMaaS` | Present in live schema; exact casing confirmed. | Use `vLLMDeploymentOnMaaS`, not `vLLMDeploymentOnMaas`. |

Observed `LLMInferenceService` `v1alpha2` fields include
`spec.model.uri`, `spec.model.name`, `spec.router.gateway.refs[]`,
`spec.router.route`, `spec.router.scheduler`, `spec.replicas`, `spec.worker`,
`spec.prefill`, `spec.parallelism`, `spec.scaling`, and
`spec.storageInitializer`. Use `oc explain` again immediately before writing
GitOps because the examples and active CRD version differ from some older
published snippets.

## API Tier And Support Posture

| Area | Current posture | Stage 230 handling |
|------|-----------------|--------------------|
| `LLMInferenceService` | Captured API tier table lists `llminferenceservices.serving.kserve.io/v1alpha1` as Tier 2. The live cluster stores `v1alpha2`, which must be rechecked against current RHOAI 3.4 docs and CRD metadata before authoring. | Prefer the live storage version only after official-doc and `oc explain` validation. Record the support posture in the README and manifest comments if the active version is Technology Preview, Beta, Alpha, or unresolved. |
| MaaS CRDs | MaaS resources are product-documented for RHOAI 3.4, but the CRDs are not present on the current cluster yet. | Install/enable MaaS prerequisites first, then validate `Tenant`, `MaaSModelRef`, `ExternalModel`, `MaaSSubscription`, and `MaaSAuthPolicy` schemas before copying quickstart examples. |
| Gateway API | Gateway API resources are present as `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1`. They are OpenShift/Kubernetes gateway resources, not RHOAI API-tier entries. | Validate listener, namespace, hostname, route, and ReferenceGrant behavior with live schema and official OpenShift/RHOAI docs before claiming MaaS access paths. |
| RBAC and access policy | Stage 230 needs both OpenShift RBAC/group membership and MaaS gateway authorization. | Do not claim access until both `MaaSSubscription` quota and `MaaSAuthPolicy` authorization are present and validated for allowed and denied subjects. |
| External OpenAI model | `gpt-5.4-nano` is selected from official OpenAI model/pricing docs as the cost-optimized GPT-5.4-class external model at planning time. | Recheck model availability and pricing before demo delivery. Store provider credentials only in local Secret material, and document that prompts leave the cluster for this model. |

## Completed Schema Checks Before MaaS Model GitOps

Completed against `cluster-klvxt` on 2026-06-12 after the OpenShift safety
guard confirmed the target cluster:

```bash
oc get crd llminferenceservices.serving.kserve.io \
  maasmodelrefs.maas.opendatahub.io \
  maassubscriptions.maas.opendatahub.io \
  maasauthpolicies.maas.opendatahub.io \
  externalmodels.maas.opendatahub.io \
  tenants.maas.opendatahub.io

oc explain llminferenceservice.spec --api-version=serving.kserve.io/v1alpha2
oc explain llminferenceservice.spec.model --api-version=serving.kserve.io/v1alpha2
oc explain llminferenceservice.spec.router.gateway --api-version=serving.kserve.io/v1alpha2

oc explain maasmodelrefs.maas.opendatahub.io.spec
oc explain maassubscriptions.maas.opendatahub.io.spec
oc explain maasauthpolicies.maas.opendatahub.io.spec
oc explain externalmodels.maas.opendatahub.io.spec
oc explain tenants.maas.opendatahub.io.spec
```

Rerun these checks after any RHOAI, RHCL, or OpenShift upgrade before changing
model, subscription, or auth-policy manifests.

Phase-one deploy and validation commands:

```bash
./stage-230-models-as-a-service/deploy.sh
./stage-230-models-as-a-service/validate.sh
```

## GitOps Ownership Decision

- Shared RHOAI owner: `stage-110-rhoai-base-platform` continues to own the
  single `DataScienceCluster`.
- Stage 230 should add focused shared-owner patches for MaaS component
  enablement and dashboard feature flags.
- Stage 230 should own its independent prerequisites and policy resources under
  `gitops/stage-230-models-as-a-service/` unless an operator or global platform
  component clearly belongs to an existing shared owner.
- Provider API keys, MaaS PostgreSQL credentials, and user API keys must be
  created from local `.env` or an approved secret store, never committed.
- Stage 230 creates an `LLMInferenceService` for Nemotron in
  `models-as-a-service`, uses the Stage 210 benchmark result to choose initial
  concurrency/token limits, and preserves the curated Nemotron vLLM/tool-calling
  configuration where the `v1alpha2` schema allows it.
- Stage 230 avoids running a second GPU-heavy Nemotron backend alongside the
  direct Stage 210 endpoint on the single default GPU node. The deploy wrapper
  deletes stale direct `demo-sandbox` Nemotron serving resources first, then
  lets Argo CD reconcile the MaaS-owned backend.
- Initial Nemotron policy should use the 2026-06-12 Stage 210 GuideLLM results:
  start the chat assistant lane at `8` active concurrent requests per replica
  with 256 output-token defaults; start the RAG lane at `2` active concurrent
  requests per replica for about 4k-token prompts and 512 output-token
  responses. Treat chat `12` and RAG `4` as burst or breakpoint candidates, not
  public default quotas.

## Planned Manifest Areas

| Area | Expected resources | Verification |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
| MaaS prerequisites | Pinned Connectivity Link Operator, `Kuadrant`, Gateway, `maas-gateway-tls`, Authorino TLS, `maas-db-config` Secret | Exact RHCL CSV, package/channel, and CRD checks; no secret values in Git |
| Shared RHOAI patch | `DataScienceCluster` MaaS enablement and dashboard feature flags | Kustomize render and live DSC status |
| Local model backend | `LLMInferenceService` for Nemotron, or another officially supported MaaS backend if schema requires it | `Ready=True`, authenticated inference, metrics |
| Local MaaS publication | `MaaSModelRef` for Nemotron | CRD schema and dashboard/API model listing |
| External provider | `ExternalModel` and `MaaSModelRef` for `gpt-5.4-nano`, provider Secret supplied locally | OpenAI model availability and Secret reference |
| Access governance | `rhods-admins` namespace admin RoleBinding, `MaaSSubscription`, `MaaSAuthPolicy`, group/user mapping, token limits, cost metadata | Allowed and denied inference tests |
| Observability | Tenant telemetry, MaaS/Kuadrant metrics, dashboard flag | Usage/rate-limit metrics visible; TP label in docs |
| Gen AI Playground | Dashboard flags, Llama Stack Operator if required, AI asset endpoint visibility | `ai-developer` sees and uses MaaS models from AI asset endpoints/playground without MaaS namespace admin rights |

## Risks And Deferred Decisions

| Item | Type | Resolution |
|------|------|------------|
| Official docs group discrepancy | resolved for current cluster | The official RHOAI 3.4 guide lists `*.maas.opendatahub.io` CRDs but shows `models.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1` YAML for several MaaS resources. The live cluster exposes MaaS resources as `maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1`; use that group/version for current GitOps. |
| `LLMInferenceService` example version drift | risk | Active cluster stores `v1alpha2`; adapt examples only after schema checks. |
| External OpenAI provider data path | risk | Document that prompts sent to `gpt-5.4-nano` leave the cluster and are subject to provider policy, region, and account settings. |
| Missing provider credential | blocker for live rollout | Do not push external-model GitOps into the Argo CD sync loop unless `openai-provider-api-key` exists in `models-as-a-service` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`RHOAI_OPENAI_API_KEY` is provided locally for `deploy.sh`. |
| Provider rate limits | risk | MaaS limits protect users from each other inside the demo, but the shared OpenAI provider key can still hit provider-level aggregate limits. |
| RHCL version drift | blocker | If a cluster already installed RHCL 1.4.x, remediate the operator lifecycle back to the pinned `rhcl-operator.v1.3.3` path before claiming MaaS gateway/dashboard readiness. Do not patch generated Kuadrant `AuthPolicy` or `EnvoyFilter` resources. |
| MaaS observability support posture | risk | Label as Technology Preview and showback-only, not billing-grade metering. |
| Stage 210 operating envelope changes | dependency | Re-run the chat/RAG GuideLLM policy profiles whenever the Nemotron model, vLLM args, GPU shape, prompt size, or output-token defaults change. |
